# Project College

This project contains the source code for my next indie project, Project College

## Summary
This game is a passion idea that I had a while back, but I never had the chance to enact on it. In order to gain more experience in game development and as a game developer, I am aiming to develop a small prototype of this project. All of itscode will be here for others to see. This section will also he a heavy WIP as the project moves along.

## Project Goals
1. See if I can create a versatile RPG engine by scratch in Unity
2. Develop and work on organizing code in a more complicated game type
3. Using Trello, layout all of the tasks that are more crucial in creating the prototype

## What's in here?
The project has numerous scenes in it that demonstrate the numerous features I built out, with one scene laying all of the basic mechanics that I want to present. A complete playthrough of the prototype will take about 3 minutes.

## How to Build and Run
There are two ways to run the prototype on this game
1. Download the most recent release found in the Release Tab and extract the .zip.
  - Go to the approperiate folder that matches your system's OS and run the .app or .exe file in that folder.
2. Clone the repo from the master branch and build the project within Unity v2018.2.4.
